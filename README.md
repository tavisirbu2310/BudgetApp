This BudgetApp was created using React and React Hooks for the state. The styling was written in CSS and CSS modules was used for a better, safer styling experience in the project. This way, all the class names were scoped locally and it was ensured that no conflict or unexpected styling result would take place.

React Hooks was chosen so that the whole project would have a core made entirely from functional components, including the stateful components.

The app is responsive so it is usable on mobile screens or other small screens too.

The user can add his monthly incomes and expenses in the app. Then, the app tells the user his total income, his total expense and how much every expense is out of the total income(in %). The user can delete an expense or an income if he/she made a mistake.

To run the budget app:

1.Clone

2.Run npm install

3.Run npm start
